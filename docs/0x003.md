## What is BTCP?

A digital asset designed to work as an exchange vehicle that utilizes cryptography to encrypt transactions.
The market of cryptocurrencies is fast and wild. Nearly every day new cryptocurrencies emerge . Every cryptocurrency comes with a promise, with a big story to turn the world around, though.

Intrestingly, the promise made by the Bitcoin Private team has been from the beginning to offer the market a currency capable of conducting transactions in a private, secure, fast and with a low transaction cost. And they have worked tirelessly to offer innovations that make this promise a reality. One of these procedures in which the Bitcoin Private team has been working is the new vendor platform that will be ready this next July 31.

We knew about this project first on March 21 with the third community update (Bitcoin Private team initially shared one, usually biweekly ).

Lately, when the community broadcasted the announcement, ...

*"It has been a pretty exciting week with new vendors deciding to accept BTCP, without any solicitation from our team. There are online businesses who continue to contact us asking how they can integrate BTCP payments into their site as well as store fronts that have gone out of their way to make a BTCP sticker to place on their door.‚Äù*

... it was well received by the community and by a surprisingly large number of vendors, who started to catalog a long list of interested parties in adopting Bitcoin Private as payment method.

But obviously, some questions come to one's mind when we talk about these new innovations! Here are some answers offered by members of the Bitcoin Private team:

#### Why do Merchants need a payment processor?

A payment processor, quite simply, handles payments on your behalf. They avoid you having to undertake huge technical, financial and legal complications and allows you to concentrate on running your business.

#### How is BTCP Pay processing different?

Instead of entering card details, the user scans a QR code on their phone and hits the send button. Aside from never having to enter card details, which is a huge plus, there are many nodes around the world that have to confirm the transaction can happen. This is the essence of ‚Äòdecentralised‚Äô blockchains vs ‚Äòcentralised‚Äô card processors. Many nodes have to confirm the transaction is legitimate rather than a single card processor. It helps ensure fraud and corruption is eradicated, because many systems have to confirm it is legitimate. Even better, the customer isn‚Äôt typing in sensitive information, like a credit card numbers and furthermore, the digital signature that is created is irreversible and for one time use only, so can safely be provided as intended.

#### Great, any other benefits?

Yes! Aside from improved security, the transactions are recognised almost instantly. The processing cost is a few ‚Äòsats‚Äô (Satoshis) which equates to a fraction of a US cent at present, so the merchant can accept payments and for a tiny transaction fee. You can send a payment to anyone worldwide with no barriers, Blockchains simply have no borders. Lastly, Bitcoin Private, the cryptocurrency used by BTCP Pay contains provably private technology, using zk-SNARKs. This technology means that the sender and receiver have no idea of each other , transactions are untraceable just as you‚Äôd want financial transactions to be.

Regarding your merchant BTCP wallet, a new payment address is created for every transaction, as the wallet you use is a HD (Hierarchical Deterministic) wallet. This is essentially a master wallet that has an infinite number of addresses within it. So while you may have taken 10,000 transactions over time, each under a new address within your HD wallet, you can collate and spend from it as a whole. This provides further privacy and untraceability for users and convenience to you.

#### Therefore, are the payments are sent directly into the merchant‚Äôs own wallet?

Bitcoin Private holds none of your money, like say a bank would‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou are essentially your own bank. As long as you keep your ‚Äòprivate key‚Äô safe, you can retrieve your funds at any time and from anywhere.

### Who controls the `data` ?

The BTCP Pay service provide options for using it, at its most basic, merchants can use BTCP Pay services via the website and they handle all payments for you, as a cloud based service and also offer further options where you can easily setup your own BTCP Pay server with a single click at large web hosting service providers such as Digital Ocean, or install on your own server easily also using handy setup guides.

#### How easy is it to install? What software are compatible with BTCP Pay?

Merchants can sign up at btcppay.com, establish their website address, customise their widget code and have it inserted into their site within minutes. BTCP Pay offer solutions to put into a standard HTML site, a WordPress plugin and a WooCommerce plugin already, with more solutions coming soon such as Shopify and others.

#### Any further improvements?

Future updates will include EPOS solutions and ‚Äòspeak to order‚Äô solutions so on-premesis services can be provided, such as in a restaurant, store, drive thru or automated ordering machine.

From a customers point of view, they can purchase using their phone, by scanning a QR code shown, confirming the amount and hitting send. The website automatically recognises this, typically within a split second and completes the order according the merchants approval rules.

Being a global solution, the widget also handles currencies from around the world, allowing the merchant to inform user of the BTCP and fiat currency cost in over 32 currencies, such as US Dollars, British Pounds Sterling, Japanese Yen and more.

### Final conclusions :

BTCP Pay offers an anonymous cryptocurrency as a payment solution.
BTCP Pay offers safely, securely and privately handle payments through their blockchain, with speed, efficiency and extremely low cost, incredibly quick and easy to setup in a variety of scenarios and both simple and fast for users to use.
